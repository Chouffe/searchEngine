#      Default Mode: Intersection queries              #
########################################################


1) Implicitly, Google returns the documents matching all the words in the Query
   AND queries by default

 The number of estimated results decreases if we add a new word in the search
 => Intersection of two sets = AND

 The words we type in the search bar are not necessarily near each other in the
 document returned => Not a phrase query

 But! We do not have the same results by typing 'a AND b' and 'b AND a' for any
 a and b. Eg: Spider Man, Man Spider even though it returns fairly the same
 amout of documents


2) Trying to find out the stop words (to, or, the, a...)

 We type queries like 'a assumed-stop-word b' and we try to find out those that
 are removed in the preprocessing (we should get the same number of results)
 I found that 'or' is preprocessed. It depends on the language set by Google.
 For instance, in french the words l', le, la, les are removed from the query

#      Phrase queries in Google Search engine          #
########################################################


1) Add double quotes to run a phrase query 

 eg. "query"
 Google returns the document containing the words close to each other
 But it returns also well ranked pages containing or not all the words of the
 query typed


2) Preprocessing of the phrase queries. It removes the character ',' ';' '.'

 In fact we find the same results if we search for 'a, b' than for 'a b'
